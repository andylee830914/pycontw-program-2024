# 錄影釋出 Recording Release

PyCon 致力於協助 Python 教育及提倡 Python 的使用，錄製的演講預設會由 PyCon Taiwan 團隊剪輯並在會後上傳至線上影音網站（如：Youtube）以及 pyvideo.org。

Since one of the PyCon motivations is to help Python education and advocate the use of Python. PyCon Taiwan Committee will record, edit, and release the audio and video of the speaker’s presentation to online video sites such as YouTube and pyvideo.org by default.

## 贊助標誌

PyCon Taiwan 能夠順利舉辦需感謝贊助商夥伴的協助，我們會在大會期間與會後上傳之演講影片的下方嵌入並輪播贊助商的標誌。如果您不希望自己的演講在大會結束後被上傳至線上影音網站，請在投稿時在「議程錄影釋出」一欄選擇「否」。

Thanks to our sponsors, we could make PyCon Taiwan one of the greatest events. We will embed sponsors' logos in the presentation videos that play during and after the conference. If you don’t want your talk being uploaded after the conference, make sure you choose “No” to the “Recording Release” option during the proposal submission.

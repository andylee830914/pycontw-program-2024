Hi Thomas,
This is Jenny from program team of PyCon Taiwan 2023 again, who sent you a keynote invitation to the conference a couple of weeks ago.
We’re glad to receive your reply via Twitter direct message on March 26th that you’re interested in coming but need more time to check.

We’re wondering if you’re still considering it?

We would appreciate it if you could RSVP by the end of April. Again, we really wish you could come and join us this year!
